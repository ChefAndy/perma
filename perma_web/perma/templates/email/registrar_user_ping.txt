TITLE: Perma.cc update: new batch link creation feature!

* We'd like to share news of an exciting new feature that is now available. Over the past year, the Perma.cc development team has been working on a function that allows users to create more than one Perma Link at a time. This feature â€“ Batch Link Creation - is now available for all your users, and could be especially helpful for those of you who support law journals.
